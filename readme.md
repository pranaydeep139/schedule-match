## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   Node.js (for `http-server` or similar, to serve the frontend)
*   A running MongoDB instance (local or on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas))

### Backend Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd schedule-match/backend
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file inside the `backend` folder and add your configuration:
    ```env
    MONGO_DETAILS="your_mongodb_connection_string"
    SECRET_KEY="your_secret_key"
    ALGORITHM="HS256"
    ```

4.  **Run the server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    The backend will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Serve the frontend files:**
    In a **new terminal**, navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    ```

2.  **Use a simple HTTP server:**
    If you have Python 3, you can use its built-in server:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```
    Or use the popular `serve` package from npm:
    ```bash
    npx serve
    ```

3.  **Access the App:**
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (for Python's server) or the URL provided by `serve` (usually `http://localhost:3000`).
